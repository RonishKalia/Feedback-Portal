It was developed as a part of our 4th semester database coursework project.

This project aims to develop an anonymous faculty feedback form through which all the students would login using their college login ID and password and give their opinion about a particular teacher teaching a particular subject. The results for each teacher would be compiled and displayed when the teacher logs in using a bar graph. The teachers will also have the privilege to compare their results over the years. This has multiple benefits over the offline method that was being used until now.
